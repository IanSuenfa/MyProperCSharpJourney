Well done Ian, I love Milo! It looks like you had a lot of fun creating that project, and you have a made an excellent start to this course. It's a shame that you had issues with your previous repository, it would have been nice to have kept a record of last week's work, but that's just a small thing. A couple comments based on the exercises this week, (mainly related to Milo, being your most significant project this week):

- - Well done for using the Thread.Sleep() method, you've shown your initiative to use something that was not taught in the module
- I remember your preference for using `string1 + " " + string2`, but you will probably find the interpolation (introduced in this module) easier to use in the future: `$"{string1} {string2}"`
- Tiny thing - just check your response to Milo's question re. favourite food. This might have been more obvious if you had used string interpolation (as mentioned above)

In summary though, a great start, Ian. Keep up the good work!
